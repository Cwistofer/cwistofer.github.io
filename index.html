  <h1>My CSE Website</h1>
  <p1> Welcome to my first website that I am making from code.</p1>
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p2> I am very new to coding with HTML and CSS but so far I am liking it and it  is pretty fun and somewhat easy.
  Python however I did not like personally because it got hard probably because I did not pay attention or turn in some 
  assignments but I did not like it that much</p2>
