  <h1>My CSE Website</h1>
  <p1> Welcome to my first website that I am making from code.</p1>
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p2> I am very new to coding but I use the computer a lot. I play PC games like Garry's Mod and World of Warcraft and I was not really 
  interested with coding until late school year in 2015. I recently started coding with HTML and CSS and so far I am liking it and it 
  is pretty fun and somewhat easy. The way HTML and CSS work together fascinates me and I feel like I will continue to do this later in 
  life considering I like this. Python however I did not like personally because it got hard and it is probably because I did not pay attention
  or turn in some assignments but overall I did not like Python that much. The learning of some concepts was cool but it was hard.
  HTML and CSS however I caught on very quickly and it has been a better experience so far.</p2>
